Effective patient scheduling  based on their preference, doctor availability and constraints is key to provide medical care that is quality and  cost effective. This project uses natural selection Algorithms to address these issues.

1. Data setup: Simulated data for patients, patient preferences, doctor availability and constraints.

2. Patient Initialization: The total initial number of patients areh generated randomly.

3. Crossover: One-point crossover applied to new schedules created from selected parents.

4. Mutate: Random mutation introduces diversity into the patients by making small random changes to medical routines.

7. Natural selection Algorithms Loop: The  algorithm loops through generations, applying crossover, and mutation to improve the quality of routines.

8. Results and Visualization: The project outputs the best scheduling solution, showing the assigned time slots for each patient. Additionally, it displays the best fitness score achieved during optimization.

Methods Used:

1. Crossover: Single-point Crossover

2. Mutation: Random Mutation
